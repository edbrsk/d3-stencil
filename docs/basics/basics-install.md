## The beginnings

This project began in [Barcelona](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona), to be accurate, in the journeys to a company which use graphs in many of their products.

Major blogs were talking about Stencil, and use it would be helpful in our case to create a small library of components with some benefits like web-components, framework-agnostic, a set of rules, have a suite of tests, etc. However, due that Stencil was in beta yet, this library none was available at that moment.

For that reason, a few months later was launched D3-Stencil. The main intention was to find a way to simplify the process to create new charts, a simple way to use them as well, and the journeys are still ongoing, so more improvements are coming, for now, let's going to see how to install D3-Stencil.

## Install

Install D3-Stencil using npm:

```bash
$ npm i d3-stencil --save
```

Or via yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add d3-stencil
```

That's it, I'm glad you want to try it! ![happy](https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/twitter/180/face-with-party-horn-and-party-hat_1f973.png)
